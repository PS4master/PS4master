# PS4 UI for Jailbreak

A clean and simple UX designed for accessing PS4 jailbreak exploits and payload hosts.  
This project does **not** include exploits or payloads — it only provides a modern user interface that redirects to trusted external hosts.

## 🚀 Features
- Minimal and fast UI for PS4 browsers
- Links to trusted PS4 jailbreak hosts
- Compatible with multiple firmware versions (e.g., 5.05, 6.72, 7.55, 9.00)
- Lightweight, fast loading, and PS4-friendly design

## 📌 What This Project Is
This repository provides:
- A **user interface (UI)** for navigating jailbreak options
- A clean design optimized for PS4's built-in browser
- Proper credits to original exploit and payload developers

## ❗ What This Project Is NOT
- This project does **NOT** contain any exploits  
- This project does **NOT** host payloads  
- All exploits/payloads belong to their original developers

## 🧩 Credits
Special thanks to the developers and researchers who created the original PS4 jailbreak payloads and exploit hosts.
